Becoming an expert in zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) requires a strong background in mathematics and computer science, specifically in the areas of number theory, cryptography, and programming. Here are some steps you can take to become an expert in zk-SNARKs:

    Start by learning the basics of number theory, cryptography, and programming. If you are not already familiar with these concepts, you will need to gain a solid foundation in them before diving into zk-SNARKs.

    Read the original papers and research on zk-SNARKs, such as "zk-SNARKs: An Introduction" by Eran Tromer, and "SNARKs for C: Verifying Program Executions Succinctly and in Zero Knowledge" by Eli Ben-Sasson, et al.

    Study the code and implementations of existing zk-SNARKs projects such as zcash, libsnark, and libff.

    Try to implement your own zk-SNARKs, start with simple examples and gradually increase the complexity of your projects.

    Join online communities and forums to connect with other experts in the field and stay up-to-date on the latest developments and research.

    Be prepared to spend a significant amount of time and effort to master this complex and evolving technology.

Keep in mind that, Zk-SNARKs are a very active area of research and development, so it's important to stay up to date with the latest developments and breakthroughs in the field.
